# Flask RESTful API Project

## About This Project
Hey! This is a simple RESTful API project made with Flask.  
Basically, it lets you do stuff like signing up, logging in, uploading files, and managing items (like creating, reading, updating, and deleting them).  
I used a MySQL database to store everything and also added some error handling to make sure it doesnâ€™t break easily.

## What It Can Do
1. User Authentication (Logging in and getting a token to use the protected routes)
2. Uploading and Viewing Files
3. CRUD Operations (Creating, Reading, Updating, Deleting items)
4. Handling Errors (Like 400, 401, 404, and 500 errors)
5. Public and Protected Routes (Some routes need you to log in first)
